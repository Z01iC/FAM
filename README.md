# FAM

In this paper we introduce a novel method of explaining neural network image classification. We introduce FAM, Feature Activation Matching, an algorithm for extracting the features a CNN recognized in a test image by matching the activations of the network with the activations of labeled feature patches. We then show how FAM can explain the classification a of test image by labeling the feature patches the neural network recognized in the image.
